Thank you for reading the readme!



BEFORE RUNNING THE EXECUTABLE OR UNITY PROJECT:
The TFTV/015 lab machines have a strange performance issue related to their resolution. Resetting the resolution fixes this.

To do this:
1. Close the executable and Unity project if currently open.
2. Open System Settings -> Display -> Advanced and tick Show Resolutions as List.
3. Press Done.
4. Set the resolution to the lowest possible setting.
5. Restore the resolution to your desired resolution (1920x1080 recommended).
6. Open the executable or Unity project.



PERFORMANCE:
The project will run adequately on the TFTV/015 lab machines, but I highly recommend giving it a try on a machine with a dedicated GPU if you're able to for the intended experience. Enjoy the game!



ASSET CREATION FILES:
Some assets like spaceships and dark textures can be hard to fully see in-game. I have included all Photoshop, Blender, etc. files (minus music creation files due to file size) in the Unity project's A3DPIE/Assets/Assets folder so you can have an in-depth look if you like :)
